  # "Movie Finder"

**Movie Finder** project is SPA (Single Page Application), catalog of some facts about movies (or only about 1 series).

## Why? 
 I plan to continue React library learning. Especially usage of new hooks, context, forms, standard libraries and API. \
 Also, starting from this project, I want to provide a minimum, but enough covering code with tests.

## TECHNOLOGIES
	- React (+ Axios)
	- Redux (+Redux-Thunk))
	- Redux Toolkit (makes Redux more friendly)
	- TypeScript (basic features)
	- Git
	- GitHub
	- Styled components

## NEW TECHNOLOGIES
	- Material UI,
	- React-Test-Library / Jest, 
	- React-hook-form,
	- Swiper
